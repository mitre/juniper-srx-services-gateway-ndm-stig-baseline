  title 'For local accounts, the Juniper SRX Services Gateway must generate an alert message to the management console and generate a log event record that can be forwarded to the ISSO and designated system administrators when local accounts are created.'
  desc 'An authorized insider or individual who maliciously creates a local account could gain immediate access from a remote location to privileged information on a critical security device. Sending an alert to the administrators and ISSO when this action occurs greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be surreptitiously created.

Automated mechanisms can be used to send automatic alerts or notifications. Such automatic alerts or notifications can be conveyed in a variety of ways (e.g., telephonically, via electronic mail, via text message, or via websites). The ALG must either send the alert to a management console that is actively monitored by authorized personnel or use a messaging capability to send the alert directly to designated personnel. Alerts must be sent immediately to designated individuals. Alerts may be sent via NMS, SIEM, Syslog configuration, SNMP trap or notice, or manned console message.

Although, based on policy, administrator accounts must be created on the AAA server, thus this requirement addresses the creation of unauthorized accounts on the Juniper SRX itself. This does not negate the need to address this requirement on the AAA server and the event monitoring server (e.g., Syslog, Security Information and Event Management [SIEM], or SNMP servers).'

show system syslog

If the system is not configured to display account creation actions on the management console and generate an event log message to the Syslog server and a local file, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', "Configure the Juniper SRX to generate and send a notification or log message immediately that can be forwarded via an event monitoring system (e.g., via Syslog configuration, SNMP trap, manned console message, or other events monitoring system). The NSM, Syslog, or SNMP server must then be configured to send the message.

The following commands configure the device to immediately display a message to any currently logged on administrator's console when changes are made to the configuration. This is an example method. Alerts must be sent immediately to the designated individuals (e.g., via Syslog configuration, SNMP trap, manned console message, or other events monitoring system).
